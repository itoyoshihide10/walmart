Introduction\n\n\n## What is Feature Engineering?\n\n### Feature Engineering is a process of extracting useful features from existing raw data using maths,statistics and domain knowledge.\n\n\n#### Feature Engineering is one of the most important steps to complete before starting a Machine Learning analysis.Most of the basic Feature Engineering techniques consist of finding inconsistencies in the data and of creating new features by combining/diving existing ones. Creating the best possible Machine Learning/Deep Learning model can certainly help to achieve good results, but choosing the right features in the right format to feed in a model can by far boost performances leading to the following benefits:\n\n* Enable us to achieve good model performances using simpler Machine Learning models.\n* Using simpler Machine Learning models, increases the transparency of our model, therefore making easier for us to understand how is making its predictions.\n* Reduced need to use Ensemble Learning techniques.\n* Reduced need to perform Hyperparameters Optimization.\n\n#### In this kernel notebook I am going to cover an exhaustive Feature Engineering topics.

Missing Data Imputation <a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n![](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/How-to-Handle-Missing-Values-with-Python.jpg)\n\n### Data in real world are rarely clean and homogeneous. Typically this is because of the following reasons\n\n1. Corrupt data\n2. Failure to load information\n3. Incomplete extraction\n4. Noisy, and inconsistent\n5. Incomplete data\n\nSo it is an important task of a Data scientist to prepossess the data by filling missing values because making the right decision on how to handle it generates robust data models. It is important to be handled as they could lead to wrong prediction or classification for any given model being used. The goal of this article is to cover the basic techniques for handling missing values in a dataset.\n\nReal-world data often has missing values.\nFirstly we cannot simply ignore missing values in a dataset. We must handle them in some way for the very practical reason that most algorithms do not accept missing values.\n\n\"Common sense\" is not sensible here.From my experience the 2 most commonly recommended ways of dealing with missing data actually are not accurate .\n\nThey are:\n\n1. Dropping observations that have missing values\n2. Imputing the missing values based on other observations\n\nDropping missing values is sub-optimal because when we drop observations, we drop information.\n\nThe fact that the value was missing may be informative in itself.We need to understand business deeper to uncover why this information is missing in real world problems.In real time problems we need to make predictions even if some of the features are missing !!!.\n\n\nImputing missing values is sub-optimal because the value was originally missing but you filled it in, which always leads to a loss in information, no matter how sophisticated our imputation method is.\n\n\"<b>Missingness</b>\" is almost always informative in itself, and we should tell our algorithm if a value was missing.Even if we build a model to impute our values, we are not adding any real information. You’re just reinforcing the patterns already provided by other features.\n\nBasically, **there are three categories of missing data**. We assume that each record or observation can be divided into an \"observable component\" and an \"unobservable component\". We also assume that the records are independent and identically distributed.\n\n1. **MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)** where the pattern of missinginess is statistically independent of the data record. Example: you have a data set on a piece of paper and you spill coffee on the paper destroying part of the data.\n\n2. **MAR (Missing At Random)** where the probability distribution of the pattern of missingness is functionally dependent upon the observable component in the record. MCAR is a special case of MAR. Example: you have a question on a survey asking if the survey participant is a drug addict and another question which asks if the survey participant has less than one alcoholic drink per year. Assume the answer to the alcoholic drink question is always observable, then the probability that someone fails to answer the drug addict question is most likely functionally dependent upon their answer to the alcoholic drink question.\n\n3. **MNAR (Missing Not at Random)** which is defined as the case which is NOT MAR. In the MNAR case, you can have situations where both the drug addict and alcoholic drink questions are absent in the same record. Another example, is a case where the question is: \"What is your gender?\" Suppose that females are less likely to answer this question than males. This is another example of an MNAR question because the probability that the answer is observable is conditionally dependent upon the unobservable component of the data record.\n\nNow that we know the basic terminology,I like to share some strategies and recommendations\n\n### Important Strategies:\n\n1. We should never insert mean, mode, median, max, min or anything else for missing values. That is, avoid deterministic imputation even though it is widely used and available in most software packages. It underestimates and distorts the statistical regularities (e.g., underestimates variance is one example) present in the data sample. \n\n2. If the data records are MCAR Then you can delete records with missing data.\n\n3. If the data records are MCAR, then sometimes you can stochastically impute the missing values rather than deterministically impute them. So this means that if you specify the marginal probability distribution of a missing value as Gaussian with some known mean and some known variance then you can sample from that distribution to impute values into the data set. We need to be careful and do some additional research  and analysis on data ,understand the business completely and take a judicious decision.\n\n4. If the data is MAR then an algorithm such as Expectation Maximization can be used to handle the missing observations.\n\n5. If the data is MNAR we can include binary indicators in the data record which explicitly identify when a variable is not observable. The challenge with this approach is that a highly nonlinear model needs to be designed to properly integrate this information in an appropriate manner. This might work in a machine learning algorithm where the binary indicators \"disconnect\" the influence of predictors which are not observable. Consequently, the MNAR theory (i.e., the theory of the joint distribution of the complete data record and missing data pattern) is instantiated in the learning machine's probabilistic model of its statistical environment.\n\n\n### Missing numeric data\n\nFor missing numeric data, we should flag and fill the values.\n\n1. Flag the observation with an indicator variable of missingness.\n2. Secondly fill the original missing value with 0 just to meet the technical requirement of no missing values.\n\nBy using this technique of flagging and filling, we are essentially allowing the algorithm to estimate the optimal constant for missingness, instead of just filling it in with the mean.\n\n### Missing categorical data\n\nThe best way to handle missing data for categorical features is to simply label them as ’Missing’!\n\n1. We are essentially adding a new class for the feature.\n2. This tells the algorithm that the value was missing.\n3. This also gets around the technical requirement for no missing values.\n\n#### For detailed understanding of missing value treatment please visit my other kernel https://www.kaggle.com/pavansanagapati/simple-tutorial-how-to-handle-missing-data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1. Complete Case Analysis<a id=\"21\"></a> <br>\n\n**Complete-case analysis (CCA)**, also called list-wise deletion of cases, consists in simply discarding observations where values in any of the variables are missing. Complete Case Analysis means literally analysing only those observations for which there is information in all of the variables (Xs). \nCCA can be applied to both categorical and numerical variables.\n\n**Assumptions**\nCCA works well when the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). In this case, excluding observations with missing data would be the same as randomly excluding some observations from the dataset, given that the missing data are totally at random. \n\n**Advantages**\n* Easy to implement\n* The same set of data is used for all analyses (no data manipulation)\n* Preserves variable distribution (if data is MCAR, then the distribution of the variables of the reduced dataset should match the distribution in the original dataset)\n\n**Disadvantages**\n* It can exclude a large fraction of the original sample, which are potentially informative for the analysis\n* CCA will be biased if the complete cases systematically differ from the original sample (e.g. when the missing information is in fact MAR or NMAR: not missing at random).\n\nIn practice, CCA may be an acceptable method when the amount of missing information is small. Unfortunately, there is no rule of thumb to determine how much missing data is small or negligible.\n\nIn many real life datasets, the amount of missing data is never small, and therefore CCA is typically never an option. \n\n## Cornell Birdcall Identification Challenge\n![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85bcf06abaadda183a88594b923f41fc.webp)\nOver 10,000 bird species occur in the world, and they can be found in nearly every environment, from untouched rainforests to suburbs and even cities. Birds play an essential role in nature. They are high up in the food chain and integrate changes occurring at lower levels. As such, birds are excellent indicators of deteriorating habitat quality and environmental pollution. However, it is often easier to hear birds than see them.\n\nWith proper sound detection and classification, researchers could automatically intuit factors about an area’s quality of life based on a changing bird population.\n\nThere are already many projects underway to extensively monitor birds by continuously recording natural soundscapes over long periods. However, as many living and nonliving things make noise, the analysis of these datasets is often done manually by domain experts. These analyses are painstakingly slow, and results are often incomplete. Data science may be able to assist, so researchers have turned to large crowdsourced databases of focal recordings of birds to train AI models. Unfortunately, there is a domain mismatch between the training data (short recording of individual birds) and the soundscape recordings (long recordings with often multiple species calling at the same time) used in monitoring applications. This is one of the reasons why the performance of the currently used AI models has been subpar.\n\n### Objective\n\nTo identify a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings. Due to the complexity of the recordings, they contain weak labels. There might be anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground. Bring new ideas to build effective detectors and classifiers for analyzing complex soundscape recordings.\n\nSo let us use the dataset of Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s Center for Conservation Bioacoustics (CCB) to do a complete exploratory data analysis and finding the insights about data and based on the findings come up with AI model that can achieve the above objective."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import Libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n# Load Data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/birdsong-recognition/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/birdsong-recognition/test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.info(),test.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"total = train.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False)\npercent = (train.isnull().sum()/train.isnull().count()).sort_values(ascending=False)\nmissing_data = pd.concat([total, percent], axis=1, keys=['Total', 'Percent'])\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 6))\nplt.xticks(rotation='90')\nsns.barplot(x=missing_data.index, y=missing_data['Percent'])\nplt.xlabel('Features', fontsize=15)\nplt.ylabel('Percent of Missing Values', fontsize=15)\nplt.title('Percentage of Missing Data by Feature', fontsize=15)\nmissing_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's go ahead and have a look at how many observations we would drop\nprint('Total bird records with values in all variables: ', train.dropna().shape[0])\nprint('Total bird records: ', train.shape[0])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In fact, we have complete information for only close 25% of our records in the above dataset.

Mean / Median / Mode Imputation<a id=\"22\"></a> <br>\n\nThis strategy can be applied on a feature which has numeric data like the age of a person or the ticket fare. We can calculate the mean, median or mode of the feature and replace it with the missing values. This is an approximation which can add variance to the data set. But the loss of the data can be negated by this method which yields better results compared to removal of rows and columns. Replacing with the above three approximations are a statistical approach of handling the missing values. This method is also called as leaking the data while training. Another way is to approximate it with the deviation of neighbouring values.

Random Sample Imputation<a id=\"23\"></a> <br>\n\nImputation is the act of replacing missing data with statistical estimates of the missing values. The goal of any imputation technique is to produce a complete dataset that can then be then used for machine learning.\n\nRandom sampling imputation is in principle similar to mean/median imputation, in the sense that it aims to preserve the statistical parameters of the original variable, for which data is missing.\n\nRandom sampling consist of taking a random observation from the pool of available observations of the variable, and using that randomly extracted value to fill the NA. In Random Sampling one takes as many random observations as missing values are present in the variable.\n\nBy random sampling observations of the variable for those instances where data is available, we guarantee that the mean and standard deviation of the variable are preserved.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n* Random sample imputation assumes that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR). If this is the case, it makes sense to substitute the missing values, by values extracted from the original variable distribution. \n* From a probabilistic point of view, values that are more frequent (like the mean or the median) will be selected more often (because there are more of them to select from), but other less frequent values will be selected as well. Thus, the variance of the variable is preserved. \n* The rationale is to replace the population of missing values with a population of values with the same distribution of the variable.\n\n**Advantages**\n* Easy to implement\n* Fast way of obtaining complete datasets\n* Preserves the variance of the variable\n\n**Limitations**\n* Randomness\n\nRandomness may not seem much of a concern when replacing missing values for data competitions, where the whole batch of missing values is replaced once and then the dataset is scored and that is the end of the problem. However, in business scenarios the situation is very different. \n\nReplacement of missing values by random sample, although similar in concept to replacement by the median or mean, is not as widely used in the data science community as the mean/median imputation, presumably because of the element of randomness.However, it is a valid approach, with advantages over mean/median imputation as it preserves the distribution of the variable."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv', usecols = ['Age', 'Fare', 'Survived'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's separate into training and testing set\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(train, train.Survived, test_size=0.3,random_state=0)\nX_train.shape, X_test.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's make a function to create 3 variables from Age 1-filling NA with median, 2- random sampling or 3- zeroes\n\ndef impute_na(df, variable, median):\n    df[variable+'_median'] = df[variable].fillna(median)\n    df[variable+'_zero'] = df[variable].fillna(0)\n    \n    # random sampling\n    df[variable+'_random'] = df[variable]\n    # extract the random sample to fill the na\n    random_sample = X_train[variable].dropna().sample(df[variable].isnull().sum(), random_state=0)\n    # pandas needs to have the same index in order to merge datasets\n    random_sample.index = df[df[variable].isnull()].index\n    df.loc[df[variable].isnull(), variable+'_random'] = random_sample","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"median = X_train.Age.mean()\nimpute_na(X_train, 'Age', median)\nX_train.head(20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let us see the distribution of the Age variable after filling NA with random value\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nX_train['Age'].plot(kind='kde', ax=ax)\nX_train.Age_random.plot(kind='kde', ax=ax, color='red')\nlines, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax.legend(lines, labels, loc='best')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let us see distribution of the Age variable after filling NA with median value\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nX_train['Age'].plot(kind='kde', ax=ax)\nX_train.Age_median.plot(kind='kde', ax=ax, color='red')\nlines, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax.legend(lines, labels, loc='best')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let us see distribution of the Age variable after filling NA with zero value\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nX_train['Age'].plot(kind='kde', ax=ax)\nX_train.Age_zero.plot(kind='kde', ax=ax, color='red')\nlines, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax.legend(lines, labels, loc='best')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.

So we might want to consider using 500 or 1000 to replace NA instead of 100.\nAs you can see this is totally arbitrary.

End of Distribution Imputation<a id=\"25\"></a> <br>\n\nOn occasions, one has reasons to suspect that missing values are not missing at random. And if the value is missing, there has to be a reason for it. Therefore, we would like to capture this information.\n\nAdding an additional variable indicating missingness may help with this task. However, the values are still missing in the original variable, and they need to be replaced if we plan to use the variable in machine learning.\n\nSometimes, we may also not want to increase the feature space by adding a variable to capture missingness.\nSo what can we do instead?\n\nWe can replace the NA, by values that are at the far end of the distribution of the variable.\n\nThe rationale is that if the value is missing, it has to be for a reason, therefore, we would not like to replace missing values for the mean and make that observation look like the majority of our observations.

Categorical Encoding <a id=\"3\"></a> <br>\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*wYbTRM0dgnRzutwZq63xCg.png)\nBetter encoding of categorical data can mean better model performance.\n\nThe categorical-encoder is the most extensive Python package for categorical variable encoding, including some common procedures like one hot encoding and weight of evidence, as well as more complex ways of encoding variables like BaseN and feature hashing. \n\nUse Category Encoders to improve model performance when you have nominal or ordinal data that may provide value.\n\n**So before get into details of encoders let us first understand how many types of data and what are they?\n**\n\nThere are four data measurement scales in research and statistics.They are \n\n* Nominal Data\n* Ordinal Data\n* Interval Data\n* Ratio Data\n\nThe Nominal and Ordinal data types are classified under categorical\n\nInterval and ratio data are classified under numerical\n\nCategorical data is a data type that not quantitative i.e. does not have a number. Therefore, both nominal and ordinal data are non-quantitative, which may mean a string of text or date. \n\n**What is Nominal Data? **\n\nNominal data is defined as data that is used for naming or labelling variables, without any quantitative value. It is sometimes called “named” data - a meaning coined from the word nominal. There is usually no intrinsic ordering to nominal data. For example, Race is a nominal variable having a number of categories, but there is no specific way to order from highest to lowest and vice versa.\n\n**What is Ordinal Data?  **\n\nOrdinal data is a type of categorical data with an order. The variables in ordinal data are listed in an ordered manner. The ordinal variables are usually numbered, so as to indicate the order of the list. However, the numbers are not mathematically measured or determined but are merely assigned as labels for opinions.\n\n\nNominal data is a group of non-parametric variables, while Ordinal data is a group of non-parametric ordered variables. Although, they are both non-parametric variables, what differentiates them is the fact that ordinal data is placed into some kind of order by their position.\n\n**For example, very hot, hot, cold, very cold, warm are all nominal data when considered individually. But when placed on a scale and arranged in a given order (very hot, hot, warm, cold, very cold), they are regarded as ordinal data.**\n\n\n**Cardinality:**\"Cardinality\" means the number of unique values in a column.\n\nFor nominal columns we use OneHotEncoder, Hashing, LeaveOneOut, and Target encoding. Avoid OneHot for high cardinality columns and decision tree-based algorithms.\n\nFor ordinal columns try Ordinal (Integer), Binary, OneHot, LeaveOneOut, and Target. Helmert, Sum, BackwardDifference and Polynomial are less likely to be helpful, but if you have time or theoretic reason you might want to try them.\n\n\n**Important Note** : We should classify data as one of seven types to make better models faster. Here are the seven data types:\n\n* Useless — useless for machine learning algorithms, that is — discrete\n* Nominal — groups without order — discrete\n* Binary — either/or — discrete\n* Ordinal — groups with order — discrete\n* Count — the number of occurrences — discrete\n* Time — cyclical numbers with a temporal component — continuous\n* Interval — positive and/or negative numbers without a temporal component — continuous\n\n\n**Classic Encoders**\nThe first group of five classic encoders can be seen on a continuum of embedding information in one column (Ordinal) up to k columns (OneHot). These are very useful encodings for machine learning practitioners to understand.\n\n* **OneHot** — one column for each value to compare vs. all other values. Nominal, ordinal.\n* **Binary** — convert each integer to binary digits. Each binary digit gets one column. Some info loss but fewer dimensions. Ordinal.\n* **Ordinal** — convert string labels to integer values 1 through k. Ordinal.\n* **BaseN** — Ordinal, Binary, or higher encoding. Nominal, ordinal. Doesn’t add much functionality. Probably avoid.\n* **Hashing** — Like OneHot but fewer dimensions, some info loss due to collisions. Nominal, ordinal.\n* **Sum** — Just like OneHot except one value is held constant and encoded as -1 across all columns.\n\n**Contrast Encoders**\nThe five contrast encoders all have multiple issues that I argue make them unlikely to be useful for machine learning. They all output one column for each value found in a column. Their stated intents are below.\n\n* **Helmert (reverse)** — The mean of the dependent variable for a level is compared to the mean of the dependent variable over all previous levels.\n* **Backward Difference** — the mean of the dependent variable for a level is compared with the mean of the dependent variable for the prior level.\n* **Polynomial — orthogonal polynomial contrasts**. The coefficients taken on by polynomial coding for k=4 levels are the linear, quadratic, and cubic trends in the categorical variable.\n\n**Bayesian Encoders**\nThe Bayesian encoders use information from the dependent variable in their encodings. They output one column and can work well with high cardinality data.\n\n* Target — use the mean of the DV, must take steps to avoid overfitting/ response leakage. Nominal, ordinal. For classification tasks.\n* LeaveOneOut — similar to target but avoids contamination. Nominal, ordinal. For classification tasks.\n* WeightOfEvidence — \n* James-Stein \n* M-estimator - Simplified target encoder."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

This is, instead of returning k-1 binary variables, they will return k, with the option in pandas of dropping the first binary variable and obtain k-1.\n\n**When should you use k and when k-1?**\n\nWhen the original variable is binary, that is, when the original variable has only 2 labels, then you should create one and only one binary variable.\nWhen the original variable has more than 2 labels, the following is important:\n\n**One hot encoding into k-1:**\n\nOne hot encoding into k-1 binary variables takes into account that we can use 1 less dimension and still represent the whole information: if the observation is 0 in all the binary variables, then it must be 1 in the final (removed) binary variable. As an example, for the variable gender encoded into male, if the observation is 0, then it has to be female. We do not need the additional female variable to explain that. \nOne hot encoding with k-1 binary variables should be used in linear regression, to keep the correct number of degrees of freedom (k-1). The linear regression has access to all of the features as it is being trained, and therefore examines altogether the whole set of dummy variables. This means that k-1 binary variables give the whole information about (represent completely) the original categorical variable to the linear regression.\nAnd the same is true for all machine learning algorithms that look at ALL the features at the same time during training. For example, support vector machines and neural networks as well. And clustering algorithms.\n\n**One hot encoding into k dummy variables**\n\nHowever, tree based models select at each iteration only a group of features to make a decision. This is to separate the data at each node. Therefore, the last category, the one that was removed in the one hot encoding into k-1 variables, would only be taken into account by those splits or even trees, that use the entire set of binary variables at a time. And this would rarely happen, because each split usually uses 1-3 features to make a decision. So, tree based methods will never consider that additional label, the one that was dropped. Thus, if the categorical variables will be used in a tree based learning algorithm, it is good practice to encode it into k binary variables instead of k-1.\nFinally, if you are planning to do feature selection, you will also need the entire set of binary variables (k) to let the machine learning model select which ones have the most predictive power.\n\nTo understand the above concept in detail let me show you by training a model on titanic data with **categorical variables re-encoded with One Hot Encoding.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df=pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv')\ntrain_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Now let us a copy of the above dataset, in which we encode the categorical variables using One Hot Encoder\n\ntrain_df_OneHotEncoder = pd.concat([train_df[['Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp','Parch', 'Survived']], #

It is mostly up to what makes sense for the data, and it also depends on what you are trying to achieve. In general, we value more model predictive power, whereas in business scenarios we want to capture and understand the information, and generally, we want to transform variables in a way that it makes 'Business sense'.

Binary creates fewer features than one-hot, while preserving some uniqueness of values in the the column. It can work well with higher dimensionality ordinal data.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n* The categories are encoded by OrdinalEncoder if they aren’t already in numeric form.\n* Then those integers are converted into binary code, so for example 5 becomes 101 and 10 becomes 1010\n* Then the digits from that binary string are split into separate columns.

It is more memory efficient. It also reduces the chances of dimensionality problems with higher cardinality.**\nMost similar values overlap with each other across many of the new columns. This allows many machine learning algorithms to learn the values similarity. Binary encoding is a decent compromise for ordinal data with high cardinality.\nFor nominal data a hashing algorithm with more fine-grained control usually makes more sense. \n## Ordinal Encoder<a id=\"314\"></a> <br>\n![](https://www.renom.jp/id/notebooks/tutorial/preprocessing/category_encoding/renom_cat_ordinal.png)\nOrdinalEncoder converts each string value to a whole number.

The first value could have been 10 and the second value could have been 3. Now they will be 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nIf the column contains nominal data, stopping after you use OrdinalEncoder is a bad idea. Your machine learning algorithm will treat the variable as continuous and assume the values are on a meaningful scale. Instead, if you have a column with values car, bus, and truck you should first encode this nominal data using OrdinalEncoder. Then encode it again using one of the methods appropriate to nominal data that we’ll explore below.\n\nIn contrast, if your column values are truly ordinal, that means that the integer assigned to each value is meaningful.

That is, to predict how likely the money lent to a person or institution is to be lost. Thus, Weight of Evidence is a measure of the \"strength” of a grouping technique to separate good and bad risk (default). \n\nIt is computed from the basic odds ratio: ln( (Proportion of Good Credit Outcomes) / (Proportion of Bad Credit Outcomes))\n\nWoE will be 0 if the P(Goods) / P(Bads) = 1. That is, if the outcome is random for that group. If P(Bads) > P(Goods) the odds ratio will be < 1 and the WoE will be < 0; if, on the other hand, P(Goods) > P(Bads) in a group, then WoE > 0.\n\nWoE is well suited for Logistic Regression, because the Logit transformation is simply the log of the odds, i.e., ln(P(Goods)/P(Bads)). Therefore, by using WoE-coded predictors in logistic regression, the predictors are all prepared and coded to the same scale, and the parameters in the linear logistic regression equation can be directly compared.\n\nThe WoE transformation has three advantages:\n* It establishes a monotonic relationship to the dependent variable.\n* It orders the categories on a \"logistic\" scale which is natural for logistic regression\n* The transformed variables, can then be compared because they are on the same scale. Therefore, it is possible to determine which one is more predictive.\n\nThe WoE also has three drawbacks:\n* May incur in loss of information (variation) due to binning to few categories (we will discuss this further in the discretisation section)\n* It does not take into account correlation between independent variables\n* Prone to cause over-fitting\n\nTo understand the concept of Weight of

It is not unusual that different labels appear in  the dataset with different frequencies. Some categories may appear a lot in the dataset, whereas some other categories appear only in a few number of observations.\n\nConsider for example a dataset with information about loan applicants for the Lending Club data exercise where one of the variables is \"city where the applicant lives\". We can imagine that cities like 'New York' may appear a lot in the data set just because New York has a huge population. On the other hand, smaller towns like 'Leavenworth' will appear only on a few occasions (if at all, population < 2000 people), just because the population there is very small.\n\nCategorical variables in business datasets very often contain a few dominant labels that account for the majority of the observations and a large number of labels that appear only seldomly. \n\n**Are Rare Labels in a categorical variable a problem?**\n\nRare values can add a lot of information at the time of making an assessment or none at all. For example, consider a stockholder meeting where each person can vote in proportion to their number of shares. One of the shareholders owns 50% of the stock, and the other 999 shareholders own the remaining 50%. The outcome of the vote is largely influenced by the shareholder who holds the majority of the stock. The remaining shareholders may have an impact collectively, but they have virtually no impact individually. \n\nThe same occurs in real life datasets. The label that is over-represented in the dataset tends to dominate the outcome, and those that are under-represented may have no impact individually, but could have an impact if considered collectively.\n\nMore specifically,\n\n- Rare values in categorical variables tend to cause over-fitting, particularly in tree based methods.\n\n- A big number of infrequent labels adds noise, with little information, therefore causing over-fitting.\n\n- Rare labels may be present in training set, but not in test set, therefore causing over-fitting to the train set.\n\n- Rare labels may appear in the test set, and not in the train set. Thus, the machine learning model will not know how to evaluate it. \n\n\n**Note** Sometimes rare values, like outliers, are worth having a look at, in particular, when we are looking for rare instances (e.g., when the target is highly unbalanced). For example, if we are building a model to predict fraudulent applications, which are in essence rare, then a rare value in a certain variable, may be indeed important. This rare value could be telling us that the observation is most likely a fraudulent application, and therefore we would choose not to ignore it.\nSo, let's go ahead and see the effect of Rare Values in Categorical variables on Machine Learning models."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv', usecols=['Embarked', 'Survived'])\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's check at the different number of labels within each variable\ncols_to_use = ['Embarked']\n\nfor col in cols_to_use:\n    print('Variable: ', col, ' Number of Labels: ', len(data[col].unique()))\n    \nprint('Total passengers: ', len(data))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's plot how frequently appears each label within a variable in the dataset\n\ntotal_passengers = len(data)\n\nfor col in cols_to_use:\n    # count the number of observations per label and divide by total \n    # number of cars\n    temp_df = pd.Series(data[col].value_counts() / total_passengers)\n    \n    # make plot with the above percentages\n    fig = temp_df.sort_values(ascending=False).plot.bar()\n    fig.set_xlabel(col)\n    fig.set_ylabel('Percentage of Passengers')\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that for each variables, 2 labels appear in more than 10% of the cars in the dataset, and one label appear in less than 10%  the passengers. **These are infrequent labels or Rare Values and could cause over-fitting.**\n\n### How is the target, \"time to pass testing\", related to these categories?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# I will work first the the variable Embarked\n\n# Let's calculate again the frequency of the different categories/labels in Embarked\n\ntemp_df = pd.Series(data['Embarked'].value_counts() / total_passengers).reset_index()\ntemp_df.columns = ['Embarked', 'Percentage of Passengers']\ntemp_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Now let's calculate the mean \"time to pass testing\" for each label in Embarked\n\ndata.groupby(['Embarked'])['Survived'].mean().reset_index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## LeaveOneOut<a id=\"334\"></a> <br>\nIt is very similar to target but avoids contamination.

The mean target value for the observed feature value `i`.\n        2. The mean target value (regardless of the feature value).\n    This can be written as::\n        JS_i = (1-B)*mean(y_i) + B*mean(y)\n    The question is, what should be the weight `B`?\n    If we put too much weight on the conditional mean value, we will overfit.\n    If we put too much weight on the global mean, we will underfit.\n    The canonical solution in machine learning is to perform cross-validation.\n    However, Charles Stein came with a closed-form solution to the problem.\n    The intuition is: If the estimate of `mean(y_i)` is unreliable (`y_i` has high variance),\n    we should put more weight on `mean(y)`. Stein put it into an equation as::\n        B = var(y_i) / (var(y_i)+var(y))\n    The only remaining issue is that we do not know `var(y)`, let alone `var(y_i)`.\n    Hence, we have to estimate the variances. But how can we reliably estimate the\n    variances, when we already struggle with the estimation of the mean values?!\n    There are multiple solutions:\n        1. If we have the same count of observations for each feature value `i` and all\n        `y_i` are close to each other, we can pretend that all `var(y_i)` are identical.\n        This is called a pooled model.\n        2. If the observation counts are not equal, it makes sense to replace the variances\n        with squared standard errors, which penalize small observation counts::\n            SE^2 = var(y)/count(y)\n        This is called an independent model.\n    James-Stein estimator has, however, one practical limitation - it was defined\n    only for normal distributions. If you want to apply it for binary classification,\n    which allows only values {0, 1}, it is better to first convert the mean target value\n    from the bound interval <0,1> into an unbounded interval by replacing mean(y)\n    with log-odds ratio::\n        log-odds_ratio_i = log(mean(y_i)/mean(y_not_i))\n    This is called binary model. The estimation of parameters of this model is, however,\n    tricky and sometimes it fails fatally.

Discretisation\n\n**Discretisation** refers to sorting the values of the variable into bins or intervals, also called buckets. There are multiple ways to discretise variables:\n\n![](https://thesaurus.plus/img/synonyms/408/discretization.png)\n\n**Discretisation approaches:**\n\nThere are several approaches to transform continuous variables into discrete ones. This process is also known as binning, with each bin being each interval.\n**\nDiscretisation methods fall into 2 categories: supervised and unsupervised. \n**\n**Unsupervised methods** do not use any information, other than the variable distribution, to create the contiguous bins in which the values will be placed. \n\n**Supervised methods** typically use target information in order to create the bins or intervals.\n\n**Unsupervised discretisation methods**\n\n* Equal width binning\n* Equal frequency binning\n\n**Supervised discretisation methods**\n\n* Discretisation using decision trees\n\n\n![](https://www.python-course.eu/images/binning.png)\nData binning, which is also known as bucketing or discretization, is a technique used in data processing and statistics. Binning can be used for example, if there are more possible data points than observed data points. \n\nAn example is to bin the body heights of people into intervals or categories. Let us assume, we take the heights of 30 people. The length values can be between - roughly guessing - 1.30 metres to 2.50 metres. Theoretically, there are 120 different cm values possible, but we can have at most 30 different values from our sample group. One way to group them could be to put the measured values into bins ranging from 1.30 - 1.50 metres, 1.50 - 1.70 metres, 1.70 - 1.90 metres and so on. This means that the original data values, will be assigned to a bin into wich they fit according to their size. The original values will be replaced by values representing the corresponding intervals. \n\nBinning is a form of quantization.Bins do not necessarily have to be numerical, they can be categorical values of any kind, like \"dogs\", \"cats\", \"hamsters\", and so on.\n\nBinning is also used in image processing, binning. It can be used to reduce the amount of data, by combining neighboring pixel into single pixels. kxk binning reduces areas of k x k pixels into single pixel.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

It looks like people between 32-40 and 48-56 are more likely to survive, than people from 40-48. This might or might not be true and more research would be needed to determine if this was the case, what the reason behind it was. In addition, it looks like being extremely old, was very favourable for survival (look at the 72-80 bucket). However, most likely, these are consequences of an arbitrary binning strategy. There are very few people in the bucket 72-80, and thus, the fact that 1 of them survived inflates (overestimates) the survival rate for that bucket. And the same is true for the remaining of the bins, the lowest the amount of observations within buckets, the highest the risk of over or underestimating the target (survival in this case). So we begin to see some of the consequences of this binning strategy.\n\n## 2. Equal Frequency Discretisation<a id=\"52\"></a> <br>\n\nEqual frequency binning divides the scope of possible values of the variable into N bins, where each bin carries the same amount of observations. This is particularly useful for skewed variables as it spreads the observations over the different bins equally. Typically, we find the interval boundaries by determining the quantiles.\n\nEqual frequency discretisation using quantiles consists of dividing the continuous variable into N quantiles, N to be defined by the user. There is no rule of thumb to define N. However, if we think of the discrete variable as a categorical variable, where each bin is a category, we would like to keep N (the number of categories) low (typically no more than 10).\n\nEqual frequency binning is straightforward to implement and by spreading the values of the observations more evenly it may help boost the algorithm's performance. On the other hand, this arbitrary binning may also disrupt the relationship with the target on occasions. Therefore, whenever possible, it will bring value to examine whether this type of binning is the right strategy, and it will depend on the variable and the algorithm that we want to use to make the predictions.\n\nI will demonstrate how to perform equal frequency binning using the Titanic dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nequal_freq_data= pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv', usecols = ['Age', 'Fare', 'Survived'])\nequal_freq_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's separate into train and test set\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(equal_freq_data[['Age', 'Fare', 'Survived']],equal_freq_data.Survived, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)\nX_train.shape, X_test.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# replace NA in both train and test sets\n\nX_train['Age'] = impute_na(equal_freq_data, 'Age')\nX_test['Age'] = impute_na(equal_freq_data, 'Age')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's remind ourselves of the original distribution\n\nequal_freq_data.Age.hist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# We will divide Age in 5 bins.

The probability is the same for all the observations within a single bin, thus replacing by the probability is equivalent to grouping the observations within the cut-off decided by the decision tree.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n* The probabilistic predictions returned decision tree are monotonically related to the target.\n* The new bins show decreased entropy, this is the observations within each bucket / bin are more similar to themselves than to those of other buckets / bins.\n* The tree finds the bins automatically\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n* It may cause over-fitting\n* More importantly, some tuning of tree parameters need to be done to obtain the optimal splits (e.g., depth, minimum number of samples in one partition, maximum number of partitions, and a minimum information gain). This it can be time consuming.\n\nBelow, I will demonstrate how to perform discretisation with decision trees using the Titanic dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, export_graphviz\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n# load the numerical variables of the Titanic Dataset\ndata_decision_tree = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv', usecols = ['Age', 'Fare', 'Survived'])\ndata_decision_tree.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's separate into train and test set\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data_decision_tree[['Age', 'Fare', 'Survived']],\n                                                    data_decision_tree.Survived, test_size=0.3,\n                                                    random_state=0)\nX_train.shape, X_test.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train['Age'] = impute_na(data_decision_tree, 'Age')\nX_test['Age'] = impute_na(data_decision_tree, 'Age')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let us now  build Classification tree using Age to predict Survived\n\ntree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)\ntree_model.fit(X_train.Age.to_frame(), X_train.Survived)\nX_train['Age_tree'] = tree_model.predict_proba(X_train.Age.to_frame())[:,1]\nX_train.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# monotonic relationship with target\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nfig = X_train.groupby(['Age_tree'])['Survived'].mean().plot()\nfig.set_title('Monotonic relationship between discretised Age and target')\nfig.set_ylabel('Survived')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Number of passengers per probabilistic bucket / bin\n\nX_train.groupby(['Age_tree'])['Survived'].count().plot.bar()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Median age within each bucket originated by the tree\n\nX_train.groupby(['Age_tree'])['Age'].median().plot.bar()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Now let us see the Age limits buckets generated by the tree by capturing the minimum and maximum age per each probability bucket, we get an idea of the bucket cut-offs\n\npd.concat( [X_train.groupby(['Age_tree'])['Age'].min(),\n            X_train.groupby(['Age_tree'])['Age'].max()], axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Conclusion**: Thus, the decision tree generated the buckets: 0-11, 12-15, 16-63 and 46-80, with probabilities of survival of .51, .81, .37 and .1 respectively.\n# 6. Outlier Engineering<a id=\"6\"></a> <br>\n\n#### What is an Outlier?\n\nAn outlier is a data point in a data set that is distant from all other observations. A data point that lies outside the overall distribution of the dataset.\n\n#### Should outliers be removed?\nDepending on the context, outliers either deserve special attention or should be completely ignored. Take the example of revenue forecasting: if unusual spikes of revenue are observed, it's probably a good idea to pay extra attention to them and figure out what caused the spike. In the same way, an unusual transaction on a credit card is usually a sign of fraudulent activity, which is what the credit card issuer wants to prevent. So in instances like these, it is useful to look for and investigate further outlier values.\n\nIf outliers are however, due to mechanical error, measurement error or anything else that can't be generalised, it’s a good idea to filter out these outliers before feeding the data to the modeling algorithm. \n\n#### What defines an outlier?\n* Data point that falls outside of 1.5 times of an interquartile range above the 3rd quartile and below the 1st quartile\n* Data point that falls outside of 3 standard deviations. we can use a z score and if the z score falls outside of 2 standard deviation\n\n#### Why do outliers exist in a dataset?\n* Variability in the data\n* An experimental measurement error\n\n#### Impact of an Outlier\n* It causes various problems during our statistical analysis\n* It may cause a significant impact on the mean and the standard deviation\n\n#### How to find an outlier?\nOutlier analysis and anomaly detection are a huge field of research devoted to optimise methods and create new algorithms to reliably identify outliers. There are a huge number of ways optimised to detect outliers in different situations. These are mostly targeted to identify outliers when those are the observations that we indeed want to focus on, for example for fraudulent credit card activity.\n\nUsing the following methods we can detect an outlier\n* IQR interquantile range\n* z score\n* Scatter plots\n* Box plot\n\n\nNow let us see how we can detect an outlier using the above methods and remove them where neccessary.

Feature Scaling <a id=\"7\"></a> <br> \n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3316/1*yR54MSI1jjnf2QeGtt57PA.png)\n**Feature scaling** in machine learning is one of the most critical steps during the pre-processing of data before creating a machine learning model. Scaling can make a difference between a weak machine learning model and a better one.\n\nThe most common techniques of feature scaling are Normalization and Standardization.\n\n**Normalisation**\n\nOne method utilised to bring all the variables to a more homogeneous scale is normalisation. Normalisation is synonym of centering the distribution. This means subtracting the mean of the variable to each observation. This procedure will \"center\" the new distribution at zero (the new mean of the variable will now be zero).\n\n**Standarisation**\n\nStandarisation is also used to bring all the variables to a similar scale. Standarisation means centering the variable at zero, and standarising the variance at 1. The procedure involves subtracting the mean of each observation and then dividing by the standard deviation:\n\nz = (x - x_mean) / std\n\n\n**Why do we need scaling?**\n\nMachine learning algorithm just sees number — if there is a vast difference in the range say few ranging in thousands and few ranging in the tens, and it makes the underlying assumption that higher ranging numbers have superiority of some sort. So these more significant number starts playing a more decisive role while training the model.\nThe machine learning algorithm works on numbers and does not know what that number represents. A weight of 10 grams and a price of 10 dollars represents completely two different things — which is a no brainer for humans, but for a model as a feature, it treats both as same.\n\nAnother reason why feature scaling is applied is that few algorithms like Neural network gradient descent converge much faster with feature scaling than without it.\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*yi0VULDJmBfb1NaEikEciA.png)\n\nOne more reason is saturation, like in the case of sigmoid activation in Neural Network, scaling would help not to saturate too fast.\n\n**When to do scaling?**\n\nFeature scaling is essential for machine learning algorithms that calculate distances between data. If not scale, the feature with a higher value range starts dominating when calculating distances, as explained intuitively in the “why?” section.\n\nThe ML algorithm is sensitive to the “relative scales of features,” which usually happens when it uses the numeric values of the features rather than say their rank.\n\nIn many algorithms, when we desire faster convergence, scaling is a MUST like in Neural Network.\n\nSince the range of values of raw data varies widely, in some machine learning algorithms, objective functions do not work correctly without normalization. For example, the majority of classifiers calculate the distance between two points by the distance. If one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance governs this particular feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance.\n\nEven when the conditions, as mentioned above, are not satisfied, you may still need to rescale your features if the ML algorithm expects some scale or a saturation phenomenon can happen. Again, a neural network with saturating activation functions (e.g., sigmoid) is a good example.\n\nRule of thumb we may follow here is an algorithm that computes distance or assumes normality, scales your features.\nSome examples of algorithms where feature scaling matters are:\n\n* K-nearest neighbors (KNN) with a Euclidean distance measure is sensitive to magnitudes and hence should be scaled for all features to weigh in equally.\n* K-Means uses the Euclidean distance measure here feature scaling matters.\n* Scaling is critical while performing Principal Component Analysis(PCA). PCA tries to get the features with maximum variance, and the variance is high for high magnitude features and skews the PCA towards high magnitude features.\n* We can speed up gradient descent by scaling because θ descends quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and oscillates inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.\n\nAlgorithms that do not require normalization/scaling are the ones that rely on rules. They would not be affected by any monotonic transformations of the variables. Scaling is a monotonic transformation. Examples of algorithms in this category are all the tree-based algorithms — CART, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. These algorithms utilize rules (series of inequalities) and do not require normalization."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,MinMaxScaler,MaxAbsScaler,RobustScaler,Normalizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n# load the numerical variables of the Titanic Dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv', usecols = ['Pclass', 'Age', 'Fare', 'Survived'])\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's look at missing data\ndata.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's separate into training and testing set\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[['Pclass', 'Age', 'Fare']],\n                                                    data.Survived, test_size=0.3,\n                                                    random_state=0)\nX_train.shape, X_test.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# let's fill first the missing data\n\nX_train.Age.fillna(X_train.Age.median(), inplace=True)\nX_test.Age.fillna(X_train.Age.median(), inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
